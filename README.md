# Java Spring Core and Spring MVC Learning Project

Welcome to my Java Spring Core and Spring MVC learning repository! This repository contains my hands-on project as I explore and deepen my understanding of Java Spring Core and Spring MVC frameworks.

## Overview

In this project, I am building a web application utilizing the power of Spring Core and Spring MVC. I'll be implementing various features and functionalities commonly found in web applications, such as URL mapping, query processing, data manipulation, and more.

## Learning Goals

- Gain a solid understanding of Java Spring Core, its IoC (Inversion of Control) container, and Dependency Injection.
- Explore Spring MVC's architecture and components to build robust web applications.
- Implement RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Integrate databases with Spring Data JPA for data persistence.
- Learn best practices and design patterns for building scalable and maintainable applications.


## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express my gratitude to the open-source community and the creators of Java Spring for providing excellent resources and documentation to aid my learning journey.

Let's learn and grow together with Java Spring Core and Spring MVC!
